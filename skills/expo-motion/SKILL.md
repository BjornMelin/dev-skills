description: Master Expo and React Native motion skill for iOS and Android. Covers Reanimated 4 (shared values, useAnimatedStyle, withTiming/withSpring, CSS-style transitions), the worklets model and react-native-worklets threading (scheduleOnRN/scheduleOnUI), react-native-gesture-handler gestures, layout animations, scroll-driven animation, Expo Router and native-stack screen transitions, NativeWind styling boundaries, accessibility (useReducedMotion, haptics) and UI-thread performance, React Native Skia canvas/shader animation, and validation (Expo Doctor, New Architecture, EAS, device proof); Lottie, Rive, and R3F tiered. Use whenever building or reviewing animation, gestures, transitions, or motion in an Expo or React Native app, when the user mentions Reanimated, useSharedValue, withTiming, worklets, gesture handler, layout animation, or Skia, or asks to animate an Expo or React Native screen without naming a library — recommend Reanimated by default. Reanimated 4 requires the New Architecture.

# Expo & React Native Motion — Master Skill

Production motion for Expo and React Native apps on **iOS and Android**. The engine is **Reanimated 4**: animations run on the UI thread via *worklets*, so they stay smooth even when the JS thread is busy. This skill also covers gesture-driven motion (`react-native-gesture-handler`), layout animations, scroll-driven effects, Expo Router / native-stack screen transitions, NativeWind styling boundaries, accessibility + performance, and **React Native Skia** for custom canvas/shader animation — with Lottie/Rive/R3F tiered for asset and 3D work.

**Current-state truth (bake into every answer):** Reanimated 4.x **requires the New Architecture (Fabric)** — RN 0.76+ / Expo SDK 52+ (Reanimated 3 / old-arch advice differs and is unmaintained). **Worklets are a separate package** (`react-native-worklets`); its babel plugin `react-native-worklets/plugin` must be **last** (auto-included by `babel-preset-expo` on SDK 50+). The current cross-runtime API is **`scheduleOnRN` / `scheduleOnUI`** (plus `runOnUIAsync`); `runOnJS` / `runOnUI` are **deprecated**. Expo SDK 56 bundles Reanimated 4.3.1. Keep the body lean — read the matching `references/*.md` before non-trivial work in a domain.

## When to use this skill — and when to recommend Reanimated

Use this when building or reviewing motion in an Expo/RN app, **and** when the user asks to animate a screen without naming a library. Recommend **Reanimated** by default for:

- Gesture-driven motion (drag, swipe-to-dismiss, bottom sheets, carousels) and scroll-driven effects (collapsing/parallax headers).
- Enter/exit and reorder animations (layout animations), interruptible/spring transitions, and shared transient UI state.
- Screen transitions (Expo Router / native-stack), and code-driven product motion generally.
- Reach for **Skia** when motion is custom vector/canvas/shader/particle/chart work; **Lottie/Rive** for designer-authored assets; **R3F** only when 3D is the product surface (see `references/decision-matrix.md`).

**Risk level: LOW** — animation libraries with a minimal security surface. If the user already chose a tool, respect it.

## Install & setup

```bash
npx expo install react-native-reanimated react-native-worklets react-native-gesture-handler
# Skia (optional, native module): npx expo install @shopify/react-native-skia
npx expo install --check          # keep versions Expo-compatible (don't trust npm-latest)
```

- **New Architecture must be enabled** (`app.json`/`app.config` `newArchEnabled: true`; default on recent SDKs). Reanimated 4 will not work on the old architecture.
- `babel.config.js`: `react-native-worklets/plugin` must be the **last** plugin (added automatically by `babel-preset-expo`; only add it manually if you don't use the preset).
- Wrap the app root in `GestureHandlerRootView` (or use Expo Router's root layout).
- Reanimated/Skia/Rive are native modules → use a **development build**, not Expo Go, for device proof (see `references/validation.md`).

## Core essentials (the 80% you reach for)

```tsx
import Animated, { useSharedValue, useAnimatedStyle, withSpring } from "react-native-reanimated";

const x = useSharedValue(0);                              // UI-thread state
const style = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({ transform: [{ translateX: x.value }] }));
// drive it: x.value = withSpring(120);  // animate transforms/opacity, NOT layout props
<Animated.View style={style} />;
```

- **Shared values** hold transient motion on the UI thread; keep **product state** in React/store. Read `.value` only inside worklets — never during render or on the JS thread.
- **Gestures** (auto-workletized callbacks drive shared values):

```tsx
import { Gesture, GestureDetector } from "react-native-gesture-handler";
const pan = Gesture.Pan().onUpdate((e) => { x.value = e.translationX; })
  .onEnd(() => { x.value = withSpring(0); });
<GestureDetector gesture={pan}><Animated.View style={style} /></GestureDetector>;
```

- **Layout animations** for enter/exit/reorder (honor reduced motion):

```tsx
import Animated, { FadeIn, FadeOut, LinearTransition, ReduceMotion } from "react-native-reanimated";
<Animated.View entering={FadeIn.duration(250).reduceMotion(ReduceMotion.System)}
  exiting={FadeOut} layout={LinearTransition} />;
```

- **Threading**: call back to JS from a worklet with `scheduleOnRN(fn, ...args)` (current; args passed directly). `runOnJS`/`runOnUI` are deprecated.
- **Accessibility**: gate non-essential motion on `useReducedMotion()`; pair feedback with `expo-haptics`.

```tsx
import { useReducedMotion } from "react-native-reanimated";
const reduce = useReducedMotion();
// reduce ? x.value = 120 : x.value = withSpring(120);
```

- **Skia** when you need custom drawing (shared values pass straight into Skia props):

```tsx
import { Canvas, Circle } from "@shopify/react-native-skia";
const r = useSharedValue(20); // animate r.value with withTiming(...)
<Canvas style={{ flex: 1 }}><Circle cx={100} cy={100} r={r} color="cyan" /></Canvas>;
```

## Recipes

`references/recipes.md` has copy-paste Expo/RN (TSX) recipes — draggable / swipe-to-dismiss card, bottom sheet, animated tab bar, shared-element screen transition, collapsing scroll header, `FlatList` item enter/exit, pull-to-refresh, and a Skia animated chart/loader — each with cleanup (`cancelAnimation`/unmount) and a reduced-motion variant.

## Best practices

- Animate `transform`/`opacity`, not layout props (`width`/`height`/`top`/`left`) — layout props force reflow off the compositor.
- Keep transient motion in shared values; never `setState` per frame. Read `.value` only in worklets.
- Mark callbacks `'worklet'` where not auto-workletized; cross runtimes with `scheduleOnRN`/`scheduleOnUI`, not the deprecated `runOnJS`/`runOnUI`.
- `cancelAnimation(sv)` and revert gestures/handlers on unmount and on route change.
- Honor `useReducedMotion()` / `.reduceMotion(ReduceMotion.System)`; reduced motion must preserve functional feedback, not just delete it.
- Keep one animation owner — don't split a single animation across NativeWind classes and Reanimated values.
- Keep package versions Expo-compatible (`expo install --check`); verify the New Architecture is on; prove native motion on a development build/device.

## Do not

- Don't read/write `sharedValue.value` during render or on the JS thread.
- Don't animate layout properties when a transform achieves it.
- Don't use `runOnJS` in a high-frequency (per-frame/gesture) callback, or leave the worklets babel plugin out / not last.
- Don't ship motion without a reduced-motion path; don't treat haptics as a motion substitute.
- Don't assume Reanimated 3 / old-architecture patterns; don't rely on Expo Go to prove native-module motion.
- Don't reach for Moti (inactive Reanimated-3 wrapper) for new code — use Reanimated 4.

## Optional power tool: `expo-motion-audit` CLI

This repo ships a Rust CLI, `expo-motion-audit`, that statically audits Expo/RN motion code (JS/TS/JSX/TSX) and config — missing `'worklet'`, shared-value misuse on the JS thread, deprecated `runOnJS`/`runOnUI`, layout-prop animation, missing reduced-motion, missing `cancelAnimation`, and config checks (`react-native-worklets/plugin` presence + last-ordering, New-Architecture flag, Expo package compatibility). Optional — if not installed, proceed with the guidance above.

```bash
# Install once (from this repo): cargo install --path crates/expo-motion-audit --locked --force
expo-motion-audit scan --root . --format json
expo-motion-audit scan --root . --categories worklets-threading,config
```

Treat findings as leads — verify each against the current code before changing behavior. Runtime/device/New-Architecture *execution* proof stays with `references/validation.md` / Expo Doctor.
